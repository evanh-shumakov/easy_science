PHP extension for learning math, physics, chemistry etc.

I've begun to learn how to create my own PHP-extensions with C language, so I've decided to start with some tools I need on daily base.
Default PHP tools for trigonometry functions require radians as a parameter, but physics, chemistry and math
shcool curriculum text books use degrees for their tasks and questions, so I started with this problem and added sine,
cosine and tangent functions which take degrees as a parameter.
